    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
		recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
		Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
		Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
		Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
		action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
		leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
			<p>
				In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
				Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
				2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
				Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
				point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
				the epithet "Oakenshield", which would remain with him even in death. Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in
				TA 2850 after his father went missing, and died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.

            <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
			<p>
				Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's company,
				along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Fíli and Kíli were
				nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of
				Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of
				the Dwarves in Thorin's company.As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent
				scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains. With the other Dwarves,
				Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil. They escaped the cells
				thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin
				and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river. At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli
				scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading
				into the mountain. Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle
				of Five Armies, and all three were buried with honor.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
			<p>
				Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
				father of Balin and Dwalin. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941
				joined Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the
				Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were
				usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in
				and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along
				with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

			<p>
				Glóin, son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company who set out to reclaim the Lonely
				Mountain in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.
				Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
				brother of Óin. In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War
				of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old. In TA 2879,
				in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in
				Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug
				wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that
				Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
			<p>
				Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who
				accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain. Balin was likely born in the Lonely
				Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven
				from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee,
				before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later,
				in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely
				Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

				Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield as a member of Thorin's Company on theQuest for Erebor, to reclaim the Lonely
				Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the
				knives" and "bending the forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow
				despite his grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be
				the strongest of the thirteen companions. Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern
				Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori. In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins
				and traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.
